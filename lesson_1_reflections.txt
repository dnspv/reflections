How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was very easy with the help of +/- sighs in front of the changed strings 
	of code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I used version control system, I would be more productive, as I could 
	track every change I do to the code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: controlling versions of code.
    Cons: human errors, lack of attention.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used for tracking codes, while Google Docs is for editing a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log <commit_id>
    git log --stat <commit_id>
    git diff <first_commit_id> <second_commit_id>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Every time you find a new bug, you can git checkout to commit where there 
	was no bug to see the difference in code between a buggy version and a 
	bug-free version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I should make a webpage, then I should try to make a django app
