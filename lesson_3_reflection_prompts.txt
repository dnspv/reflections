When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I want to collaborate with my collegues or community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because I want a stronger control on my commits, commiting only working changes to my code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones in terms of Github, not local git storage.
	Clones are full copies of git (and github) branches, including all reachable commits.
	Branches are... well, branches from the main project branch (i.e. master)
